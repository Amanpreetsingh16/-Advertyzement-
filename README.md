## Steps I followed to make this assignment
First I made component folder in which I made 2 .jsx files one for navbar and other for displaying data which we fetch from the given API . 
In navbar I made a button and by using useState , useEffect react hooks I manipulated the data which I fetched using axios which  is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.I also made use of materialUi for making navbar and card structure.
